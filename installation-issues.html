            <p>Internet Explorer 7 was tested thoroughly to ensure the highest possible product quality and user experience. Much of that time was spent on the setup and installation process, to help prevent installation problems and try to ensure a malware free system prior to users launching Internet Explorer 7 for the first time. Despite the extensive testing performed, along with the broad user community feedback during the Beta testing phases, end user machines can have a virtually unlimited combination of configurations so it is impossible to ensure all installations will go flawlessly.</p>
            <div class="qabox">
              <p class="qap"><strong>Question</strong>: Ive tried installing Internet Explorer 7 and the installation is not working. I cant get a functioning browser at all now, do I need to reinstall the system?</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, there are a few options you can try to remove the Internet Explorer 7 installation and try to install again.</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Solution</strong>: Internet Explorer 7 installs as a separate program and registers in the Add/Remove control panel. The easiest mechanism for removing inoperable Internet Explorer 7 installations is to use that interface to remove it. The steps needed are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Click Start, then Run</li>
                <li>In the Open box, type appwiz.cpl, and then click OK.</li>
                <li>In the list of programs, click Windows Internet Explorer 7, and the click the Remove button.</li>
                <li>Follow the wizard instructions to uninstall Internet Explorer 7.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="qap">If that method does not work properly, you can manually run the uninstall program by the following (you will need to ensure hidden folders and files are visible):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Click Start, then Run</li>
                <li>In the Open box, type %windir%\ie7\spuninst\spuninst.exe, and then click OK.</li>
                <li>Follow the wizard instructions to uninstall Internet Explorer 7.</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="qap"><strong>Question</strong>: In our testing Internet Explorer 7 requires two reboots to install and update, can I get this down to one?</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, unfortunately the shared system components used by Internet Explorer and the rest of the Windows operating system make this impossible. During install many of the core OS components are being loaded, unloaded and modified. The system must be restarted in order to properly complete the registration activity, as well as ensure all shared components have been unloaded by other programs. Failing to properly reboot may cause the system to end up in an unknown and unsupported state.</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Solution</strong>: The system must reboot twice in order to properly complete the installation and updates. Certain updates can be completed in the first reboot, while others are performed after the first set are complete. The order integrity must be maintained to avoid having a machine in an unsupported state.</p>

            <div class="qabox">
              <p class="qap"><strong>Question</strong>: Wed like to minimize our application compatibility issues, can we deploy Internet Explorer 7 along with Internet Explorer 6?</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, that installation option is not possible. Internet Explorer is a Windows system component and contains several core operating system pieces that are quite different between Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7. One of those core elements is MSHTML.DLL, which is the main rendering engine used by Internet Explorer. Many of the standards support and layout improvements made in Internet Explorer 7 are only possible with the newer MSHTML.DLL. The Windows operating system cannot have two of these files loaded and available, or the system would not operate properly.</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Solution</strong>: Microsoft recommends that enterprise customers properly evaluate, test and then deploy Internet Explorer 7. If certain deployment blocking issues are encountered during testing, this document should help provide solutions or workarounds to any major issue. In the event a user requires having both versions of Internet Explorer installed on one machine, the solution is to use a Virtual PC image to run another instance of Windows on that machine. Microsoft regularly makes a six month development and testing image available for users. The image is refreshed shortly before it expires to ensure an operational version is always available. You can build your own VPC image to avoid regularly replacing VPC images on any machines in your environment. You can also setup a regular desktop machine in your environment and remote desktop into it if you do not want to run VPC images.</p>

              <p class="qap"><strong>Question</strong>: During the setup and installation process, Internet Explorer wants to run the Malicious Spyware Removal Tool. What is that and do I need to let it run?</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Malicious Spyware Removal Tool (MSRT) is a simple anti-spyware tool provided by Microsoft to help identify and remove many common malicious and unwanted software applications. The tool is updated on a regular basis with the most common software signatures, and is designed to isolate and remove those applications so they do not harm the users system. By design, Internet Explorer 7 wants to run the MSRT prior to installation to help ensure the system is free of malicious or unwanted software.</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Solution</strong>: Running the MSRT is an optional activity. Microsoft recommends using the MSRT to help increase the security of an Internet Explorer 7 installation. The default configuration of the standard Internet Explorer 7 package as delivered by Microsoft will prompt users to run the MSRT. If you would prefer not to run the MSRT at install (or would prefer to make other changes to the default installation package), you will need to use the Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK) 7 to build a custom Internet Explorer 7 package with your preferred settings, and then deploy that MSI package using your Software Management System (SMS) infrastructure (or similar software delivery system).</p>

              <p class="qap"><strong>Question</strong>: Weve used the Internet Explorer Administration Kit to build a custom Internet Explorer 7 build for our organization. Is there an MSI package option for the IEAK?</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Answer</strong>: Microsoft re-released builds of the IEAK and Internet Explorer 7 in October 2007. IEAK versions prior to that version did not allow for the creation of MSI packages.</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Solution</strong>: In order to create an MSI package and build updated custom packages of Internet Explorer 7, you will need to ensure you are using the most recent version of the IEAK 7 as well as the most recent version of Internet Explorer 7. The most recent version of the IEAK 7 can be downloaded from <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/bb219543.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/bb219543.aspx</a>. When running the IEAK 7 you will be prompted to verify you have the most recent version of Internet Explorer 7, and the IEAK 7 will download it if necessary so you do not need to download it separately.</p>

              <p class="qap"><strong>Question</strong>: Weve used the Internet Explorer Administration Kit to build a custom Internet Explorer 7 build for our organization. Why are we seeing that some installations appear to complete properly but the customizations are not there, and other times we see some issues where SMS installations are not working?</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Answer</strong>: There is an issue with the way SMS settings must be configured to properly install an IEAK 7 built package using SMS.</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Solution</strong>: In order to successfully deploy Internet Explorer 7 using SMS, you need to ensure the run when user is logged on flag is enabled in the SMS configuration window.</p>

              <p class="qap"><strong>Question</strong>: After upgrading to Internet Explorer 7, some toolbars arent working properly (or the system is running very slowly). What is causing the problem?</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Answer</strong>: While most add-ons are developed and function properly regardless of Internet Explorer version, some add-ons may experience problems based on the changes in designs made to Internet Explorer 7. Most often those issues are related to changes made on Windows Vista and Protected Mode, but other problems have come up with system performance or resource issues.</p>
              <p class="qap"><strong>Solution</strong>: The best way to troubleshoot add-on and Browser Helper Object (BHO) issues is to run Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode. In this mode, Internet Explorer loads the minimum components needed to operate, so you can verify the base installation is functioning properly. Once you have verified things are working normally with no add-ons, you should try to add back add-ons one at a time to identify which one is causing the issue. You can do this by disabling all add-ons via Manage Add-ons and disabling each control manually, then enabling one control at a time until you find the item causing the issue.</p>
              <p class="qap">To start in No Add-ons Mode you can choose either path:</p>
<pre><code>
Click Start, then Run
In the Open box, type iexplore extoff, and then click OK
</pre></code> 
              <p class="qap">Or</p>
<pre><code>
Click Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)
</pre></code>
